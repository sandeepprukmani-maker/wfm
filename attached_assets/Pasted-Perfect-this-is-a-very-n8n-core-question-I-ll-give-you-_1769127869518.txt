Perfect—this is a very n8n-core question 👍
I’ll give you a complete local setup first, then a clear mental model, and finally a practical list of node categories (not just random names, but how to think about them).

I’ll avoid Docker, since you’ve repeatedly said you want things running directly on your laptop.

⸻

1️⃣ What n8n actually is (in simple words)

n8n is a visual workflow engine where:
	•	You drag & drop nodes
	•	Wire them together
	•	Each node:
	•	Receives data (JSON)
	•	Does something (API call, logic, DB query, wait, IF, etc.)
	•	Passes output to the next node
	•	You can run, debug, and see execution logs

Think of it as:

Airflow + Postman + Logic + UI, but lightweight and interactive.

⸻

2️⃣ Local n8n setup (NO Docker)

✅ Prerequisites

You only need:
	•	Node.js ≥ 18
	•	npm

Check versions

node -v
npm -v

If Node is missing → install from nodejs.org (LTS)

⸻

✅ Install n8n globally

npm install -g n8n

Verify:

n8n --version


⸻

✅ Start n8n locally

n8n

You’ll see logs like:

Editor is now accessible via:
http://localhost:5678

Open in browser 👉 http://localhost:5678

🎉 Done.
You now have:
	•	Full UI
	•	Drag & drop
	•	Execution logs
	•	All nodes enabled
	•	Free & local

⸻

3️⃣ What you see in the UI (important)

Left side
	•	Nodes panel (all nodes)

Center
	•	Canvas
	•	Drag nodes here
	•	Connect outputs → inputs

Bottom
	•	Execution log
	•	Input/output JSON for every node
	•	Errors, retries, timings

This is where n8n shines compared to CLI tools.

⸻

4️⃣ Core node categories (THIS is the important part)

Instead of dumping 300 node names, here’s the right way to understand n8n nodes.

⸻

🔹 A. Trigger Nodes (Workflow starters)

These start workflows.

Node	Purpose
Manual Trigger	Click ▶ Run
Webhook	Trigger via HTTP
Cron	Scheduled runs
Interval	Run every X seconds
Error Trigger	On workflow failure

👉 You’ll use Manual + Webhook + Cron 90% of the time.

⸻

🔹 B. HTTP & API Nodes (most used)

Node	Purpose
HTTP Request	Call any REST API
GraphQL	GraphQL APIs
OAuth2 API	Auth-based APIs

Example:
	•	Call Google
	•	Call Airflow API
	•	Call internal services
	•	Call Swagger-based APIs

⸻

🔹 C. Logic / Flow Control Nodes (brain of workflows)

These replace if/else, loops, conditions.

Node	Purpose
IF	Conditional logic
Switch	Multiple conditions
Merge	Combine branches
Wait	Pause execution
Loop Over Items	Iterate array
NoOp	Dummy connector

👉 This is where decision-making happens.

⸻

🔹 D. Data Transformation Nodes (ETL-style)

Node	Purpose
Set	Create / modify fields
Function	Custom JS logic
Function Item	JS per item
Code	New unified JS node
Move Binary Data	File handling
Split In Batches	Chunk processing

Think of these as:

pandas / Python logic but visual + JS

⸻

🔹 E. Database Nodes

Supports most DBs out of the box.

Node	DB
MySQL	
PostgreSQL	
MSSQL	
SQLite	
Oracle	
MongoDB	
Redis	

Use cases:
	•	Validate counts
	•	Compare Airflow output vs DB rows
	•	Store execution metadata

⸻

🔹 F. File & Storage Nodes

Node	Purpose
Read Binary File	
Write Binary File	
FTP / SFTP	
Google Drive	
S3	
Local filesystem	


⸻

🔹 G. Messaging / Notification Nodes

Node	Purpose
Slack	
Email	
Discord	
Telegram	
Webhook Response	

Useful for:
	•	Pipeline status
	•	Alerts
	•	Failures

⸻

🔹 H. Dev / Utility Nodes (underrated but powerful)

Node	Purpose
Execute Command	Run shell commands
Execute Workflow	Reusable workflows
Error Trigger	
Stop and Error	
Start	

You can:
	•	Trigger Airflow CLI
	•	Run scripts
	•	Chain workflows

⸻

🔹 I. Testing / Validation Style Use

n8n isn’t a “testing tool”, but you can test APIs easily:

Workflow example:

HTTP Request → IF (status === 200)
               ├─ PASS
               └─ FAIL → Stop & Error

You can:
	•	Assert status codes
	•	Validate response body
	•	Loop over APIs from Swagger
	•	Log results

⸻

5️⃣ “All possible nodes” — reality check

n8n has 300+ nodes, including integrations like:
	•	AWS
	•	Azure
	•	GitHub
	•	Jira
	•	Salesforce
	•	Google APIs
	•	Stripe
	•	Notion

📌 Important truth:

You’ll realistically use 20–30 nodes for 95% of use cases.

⸻

6️⃣ Your exact use cases (based on your past questions)

Given you:
	•	Work with Airflow
	•	Validate logs + DB
	•	Want decision-based workflows
	•	Prefer no Docker
	•	Want prompt-driven automation

n8n fits very well for:
	•	Trigger Airflow DAG via API
	•	Poll DAG status
	•	Validate DB counts
	•	Compare logs vs SQL results
	•	Notify or fail pipeline

⸻

7️⃣ Next logical step (recommended)

If you want, next I can:

1️⃣ Create a first workflow:
	•	GET google.com
	•	Capture status
	•	Increment it
	•	Print logs

2️⃣ Build an Airflow-trigger + validate workflow

3️⃣ Show how to generate workflows from prompts (your big idea)

Just tell me which one and I’ll go step-by-step, hands-on 🚀
